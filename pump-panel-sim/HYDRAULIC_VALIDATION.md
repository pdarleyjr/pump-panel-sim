**Phase**: 6.1 - Pierce PUC Spec Verification  
**Purpose**: Verify hydraulic calculations match Pierce PUC fire pump specifications and fire service standards

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the verification of hydraulic calculations in the Fire Pump Panel Simulator against Pierce PUC (Pumper Unit Controller) specifications, NFPA standards, and fire service best practices.

### Validation Status: **IN PROGRESS**

---

## 1. Pierce PUC Pump Specifications

### Current Implementation
**File**: [`src/sim/pierce-puc.ts`](src/sim/pierce-puc.ts:1)

**Specifications Reviewed**:
- **Water Tank**: 500 gallons (line 193)
- **Foam Tank**: 30 gallons concentrate (line 189)
- **DRV Setpoint**: 200 PSI (line 206)
- **Engine RPM Range**: 700-2200 (governor.ts line 88)
- **Discharge Lines**: 10 outlets (4x 1.75", 4x 2.5", 1x 3.0", 1x 5.0" LDH)

### Industry Standard Pierce PUC Configurations
**Common Ratings**:
- **1250 GPM @ 150 PSI** (small pumper)
- **1500 GPM @ 150 PSI** (standard pumper) ← **CURRENT SIMULATION**
- **2000 GPM @ 150 PSI** (heavy pumper)

**NFPA 1901 Requirements**:
- Pump must deliver:
  - 100% rated capacity @ rated pressure (1500 GPM @ 150 PSI)
  - 70% rated capacity @ 200 PSI (1050 GPM @ 200 PSI)
  - 50% rated capacity @ 250 PSI (750 GPM @ 250 PSI)
- Maximum pressure typically 400 PSI (relief valve setting)
- Engine RPM range: 600-2200 typical for diesel

### ✅ VERIFIED - Pump Rating
**Verdict**: **CORRECT**
- Simulator uses 1500 GPM @ 150 PSI rating (pump-curves.ts line 7)
- NFPA test points correctly defined (pump-curves.ts lines 21-25)
- Rating matches common Pierce PUC configuration

### ⚠️ ISSUE #1 - Missing Churn Pressure Point
**Location**: [`src/sim/pump-curves.ts`](src/sim/pump-curves.ts:21-25)  
**Problem**: Pump curve only defines points from 750 GPM to 1500 GPM. Missing 0 GPM (churn) point.  
**Impact**: Cannot accurately calculate pressure at low/no flow conditions  
**Expected**: Typical 1500 GPM pump churn pressure is **280-300 PSI**  
**Recommendation**: Add churn point to NFPA_PUMP_CURVE array

### ⚠️ ISSUE #2 - DRV Setpoint Too Low
**Location**: [`src/sim/pierce-puc.ts`](src/sim/pierce-puc.ts:206)  
**Current**: 200 PSI  
**Expected**: 250-300 PSI for 1500 GPM pump  
**Rationale**: DRV should be set ~50-100 PSI above maximum operating pressure (250 PSI @ 50% capacity)  
**Recommendation**: Change default to 275 PSI

### ✅ VERIFIED - Tank Capacity
**Verdict**: **CORRECT**
- 500 gallon water tank is standard for Class A pumper
- 30 gallon foam concentrate tank is appropriate for Class A foam system

---

## 2. Pump Curve Validation

### Current Implementation
**File**: [`src/sim/pump-curves.ts`](src/sim/pump-curves.ts:1)

### Mathematical Model Analysis

**Centrifugal Pump Laws Applied**:
```typescript
// Pressure scales with RPM² (line 76)
rpmPressureFactor = (rpm / ratedRpm)²
pressure = basePressure * rpmPressureFactor

// Flow scales with RPM (implicit in curve lookup)
effectiveFlow = actualFlow / rpmFactor
```

### ✅ VERIFIED - Centrifugal Pump Physics
**Verdict**: **CORRECT**
- Affinity laws properly applied: P ∝ RPM² (line 76)
- Flow-pressure relationship uses NFPA curve interpolation (lines 58-73)
- Intake pressure boost/penalty correctly added (line 82)

### ⚠️ ISSUE #3 - Incomplete Pump Curve
**Current Curve Points**:
| Flow (GPM) | Pressure (PSI) | % Capacity |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| 750        | 250           | 50%        |
| 1050       | 200           | 70%        |
| 1500       | 150           | 100%       |

**Missing Critical Points**:
| Flow (GPM) | Pressure (PSI) | % Capacity | Status |
|------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 0          | 280-300       | Churn      | ❌ MISSING |
| 1875       | 120-130       | 125%       | ❌ MISSING |
| 2250       | 90-100        | 150% (runout) | ❌ MISSING |

**Impact**: 
- Cannot accurately model shutoff (churn) pressure
- Cannot warn about runout conditions (>150% capacity)
- Pressure calculations may be inaccurate at extremes

**Recommendation**: Expand NFPA_PUMP_CURVE to include full operating range

### Pump Curve Shape Analysis
**Expected Characteristics**:
- Smooth downward curve (pressure decreases as flow increases)
- Steeper drop at high flows (approaching runout)
- No discontinuities or unrealistic jumps

**Current Implementation**: ✅ Linear interpolation between points is reasonable but could be improved with polynomial fit for more realistic curve shape

---

## 3. Friction Loss Calculations

### Current Implementation
**File**: [`src/hydraulics/formulas.ts`](src/hydraulics/formulas.ts:1)

### Formula Verification

**Hazen-Williams Formula** (Standard in Fire Service):
```
FL = (Q^1.85 × L) / (C^1.85 × d^4.87) × k
```
Where k is a constant that varies by units

### ⚠️ ISSUE #4 - Duplicate Formulas with Different Coefficients
**Location**: formulas.ts

**Implementation #1** (lines 30-41):
```typescript
h100_ft = 0.2083 * (100/C)^1.852 * Q^1.852 / d^4.8655
FL_psi = h100_ft * 0.433  // Convert feet to PSI
```

**Implementation #2** (lines 106-111):
```typescript
flPer100 = 4.52 * Q^1.85 / (C^1.85 * d^4.87)
```

**Analysis**:
- Implementation #1: Uses head loss formula with conversion to PSI
- Implementation #2: Direct PSI calculation
- Different exponents: 1.852 vs 1.85, 4.8655 vs 4.87
- Both claim to be Hazen-Williams but use different constants

**Standard Fire Service Formula**:
```
FL_psi = 2Q² + Q  (for 2.5" hose, rule of thumb)
FL_psi = C×Q²×L / (d^5)  (simplified Hazen-Williams)
```

**Recommendation**: 
1. Consolidate to single formula
2. Verify coefficients against NFPA Pump Operations textbook
3. Add unit tests with known friction loss values

### Test Case Comparison

**Standard Attack Line**: 1.75" × 200 ft @ 150 GPM, C=150

**Expected Loss**: ~50-70 PSI (from fire service tables)

**Current Formula #1 Result**: (Need to calculate)
**Current Formula #2 Result**: (Need to calculate)

**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION

### ✅ VERIFIED - Friction Loss Principles
**Verdict**: **CORRECT CONCEPTUALLY**
- Friction increases with flow (squared relationship) ✅
- Friction increases with length (linear relationship) ✅
- Friction decreases with diameter (inverse relationship) ✅
- C-factor properly affects friction ✅

---

## 4. Intake Pressure Calculations

### Current Implementation
**File**: [`src/sim/engine.ts`](src/sim/engine.ts:361-393)

### Water Source Pressure Analysis

| Source | Current (PSI) | Expected (PSI) | Status |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Tank | 45 (when open) | 40-50 | ✅ GOOD |
| Hydrant | 50 (default) | 40-100 (variable) | ✅ GOOD |
| Draft (primed) | -5 | -5 to -15 | ⚠️ LOW |
| Draft (not primed) | -22 | -22 to -29 | ✅ GOOD |
| Relay | 20 (default) | 20-60 | ✅ GOOD |

### ⚠️ ISSUE #5 - Tank Static Head Not Modeled
**Location**: engine.ts line 370  
**Current**: Fixed 45 PSI when tank-to-pump valve open  
**Problem**: Doesn't account for water level in tank  
**Physics**: Pressure = 0.433 PSI × depth_in_feet  
**Calculation**:
- Full 500-gallon tank ~3 feet deep = 1.3 PSI static head
- Plus pump location below tank = ~40-45 PSI boost (from pump design)

**Verdict**: ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** - Current value is reasonable approximation

### ⚠️ ISSUE #6 - Draft Pressure When Primed Too High
**Location**: engine.ts line 383  
**Current**: -5 PSI when primed and flowing  
**Expected**: -10 to -15 PSI (3-6 inHg vacuum)  
**Impact**: Underestimates difficulty of drafting  
**Recommendation**: Change to -12 PSI (-5 inHg)

---

## 5. Discharge Line Pressure Calculations

### Current Implementation
**File**: [`src/sim/engine.ts`](src/sim/engine.ts:140-194)

### PDP Formula Verification
```
PDP = NP + FL + APP + ELEV
```
Where:
- NP = Nozzle Pressure
- FL = Friction Loss
- APP = Appliance Loss  
- ELEV = Elevation Loss

### ✅ VERIFIED - PDP Calculation Structure
**Location**: formulas.ts line 62-81, engine.ts line 181-186  
**Verdict**: **CORRECT**
- Formula structure is accurate
- Components properly summed
- Elevation conversion correct (0.433 PSI/ft in formulas.ts, 0.434 PSI/ft in engine.ts)

### ⚠️ ISSUE #7 - Inconsistent Elevation Coefficient
**Locations**: Multiple files  
**Values Found**:
- 0.433 PSI/ft (formulas.ts line 40, 124) ← **More accurate**
- 0.434 PSI/ft (formulas.ts line 78) ← **Common approximation**

**Standard**: 0.433 PSI per foot of elevation (based on water column)  
**Recommendation**: Standardize to 0.433 PSI/ft throughout

### Nozzle Pressure Standards

| Nozzle Type | Required PSI | Current (standards.ts) | Status |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|--------|
| Handline Smooth Bore | 50 | 50 | ✅ |
| Handline Fog | 100 | 100 | ✅ |
| Master Smooth Bore | 80 | 80 | ✅ |
| Master Fog | 100 | 100 | ✅ |

**Verdict**: ✅ **ALL CORRECT** per NFPA and IFSTA standards

---

## 6. Cavitation Detection

### Current Implementation
**File**: [`src/sim/engine.ts`](src/sim/engine.ts:437-442)

```typescript
const isCavitating = (intakePsi < 5) && (actualRpm > 2000);
// Apply 20% performance degradation
if (isCavitating) {
  achievedPDP *= 0.8;
}
```

### ⚠️ ISSUE #8 - Oversimplified Cavitation Model
**Current Logic**: Triggers when intake < 5 PSI AND RPM > 2000  
**Problem**: Doesn't account for flow rate or NPSH requirements

**Real Cavitation Physics**:
```
NPSH_available = (Intake_PSI + Atmospheric_PSI) - Vapor_Pressure
NPSH_required = f(flow_rate, pump_design)
Cavitation occurs when NPSH_available < NPSH_required
```

**Typical Values**:
- NPSH_required for 1500 GPM @ 100% capacity: ~15 ft (6.5 PSI)
- NPSH_required increases with flow
- Cavitation more likely at high flow, not just high RPM

**Current Model Assessment**:
- ✅ Correctly identifies low intake pressure as problem
- ✅ Applies performance degradation (20% is reasonable)
- ⚠️ Misses flow rate dependency
- ⚠️ RPM threshold arbitrary (should relate to flow)

**Recommendation**: Improve to:
```typescript
const npshRequired = 6.5 + (totalFlowGpm / 1500) * 10; // Increases with flow
const npshAvailable = intakePsi + 14.7 - 0.5; // Atmospheric - vapor pressure
const isCavitating = npshAvailable < npshRequired;
```

### ✅ VERIFIED - Cavitation Effects
**Performance Degradation**: 20% reduction is realistic  
**Warning System**: Properly alerts operator ✅

---

## 7. Governor System Accuracy

### Current Implementation
**File**: [`src/sim/governor.ts`](src/sim/governor.ts:1)

### PID Controller Analysis

**Pressure Mode PID Gains** (line 64-66):
```typescript
Kp = 0.6   // Proportional gain
Ki = 0.08  // Integral gain  
Kd = 0.02  // Derivative gain
```

### ✅ VERIFIED - PID Control Structure
**Verdict**: **CORRECT**
- Proper PID formula implementation (lines 68-81)
- Anti-windup protection (lines 72-74)
- Derivative calculation (lines 77-78)
- RPM clamping (line 88)

**Tuning Assessment**:
- Kp = 0.6: Moderate proportional response ✅
- Ki = 0.08: Slow integral buildup (good for stability) ✅
- Kd = 0.02: Light derivative damping ✅
- Overall: Conservative tuning favors stability over speed ✅

### Governor Mode Switching

**Current Rules**:
- PSI mode → RPM mode: When PDP > 250 PSI (line 339)
- RPM mode → PSI mode: When PDP < 240 PSI (line 349)
- 10 PSI hysteresis prevents oscillation ✅

### ✅ VERIFIED - Mode Validation Logic
**Location**: governor.ts lines 229-284  
**Verdict**: **CORRECT**
- RPM mode restricted to drafting or PDP > 250 PSI ✅
- PSI mode preferred for normal operations ✅
- Appropriate warnings generated ✅

**Matches Pierce PUC Operation**:
- PSI mode provides surge protection ✅
- RPM mode for drafting (prevents governor hunting) ✅
- Auto-switch at 250 PSI threshold (prevents hunting) ✅

## 8. System Limitations

### Current Limits

| Parameter | Current Limit | Expected | Status |
|-----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Max Discharge Pressure | 400 PSI | 400 PSI | ✅ |
| Max Flow Rate | Unlimited | 2250 GPM (150%) | ⚠️ MISSING |
| Engine RPM Min | 700 | 600-700 | ✅ |
| Engine RPM Max | 2200 | 2200-2400 | ✅ |
| DRV Relief Pressure | 200 PSI | 250-300 PSI | ⚠️ LOW |
| Overpressure Time | 5 sec | 3-5 sec | ✅ |

### ⚠️ ISSUE #9 - No Maximum Flow Limit
**Location**: pump-curves.ts, engine.ts  
**Problem**: Pump can theoretically deliver unlimited flow  
**Expected**: Maximum flow should be 150% rated = 2250 GPM (runout)  
**Impact**: Unrealistic performance at very high flows  
**Recommendation**: Add flow capping and runout warning

### ⚠️ ISSUE #10 - DRV Setpoint (Repeated)
**See Issue #2 above**

### ✅ VERIFIED - Overpressure Protection
**Location**: engine.ts lines 459-506  
**Verdict**: **CORRECT**
- 400 PSI threshold appropriate ✅
- 5 second timer before hose burst ✅
- Warning countdown displayed ✅
- Automatic valve closure on burst ✅
