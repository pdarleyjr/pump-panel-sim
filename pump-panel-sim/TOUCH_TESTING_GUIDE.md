## Test Scenarios

### 1. Single Touch Control Manipulation

#### Test: Throttle Lever
**Objective:** Verify smooth throttle control with single finger

1. Locate the throttle lever (large vertical lever, center-left)
2. Touch and drag upward (increases throttle)
3. Touch and drag downward (decreases throttle)

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Lever moves smoothly following finger
- ‚úÖ Value display updates in real-time
- ‚úÖ No lag or stuttering
- ‚úÖ Lever snaps to finger position immediately

**Known Issues to Watch For:**
- ‚ùå Lever jumping to incorrect position
- ‚ùå Control not responding to initial touch
- ‚ùå Lever continuing to move after finger lift

#### Test: Rotary Knobs (Discharge Valves)
**Objective:** Verify rotary knob rotation with single finger

1. Locate discharge valve knobs (multiple knobs across panel)
2. Touch and drag in circular motion
3. Try both clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Knob rotates following finger angle
- ‚úÖ Percentage value updates correctly
- ‚úÖ Visual rotation matches touch position
- ‚úÖ Can rotate full 360 degrees

**Known Issues to Watch For:**
- ‚ùå Knob snapping to wrong angles
- ‚ùå Rotation direction reversed
- ‚ùå Dead zones in rotation

### 2. Simultaneous Control Adjustment

#### Test: Two Controls at Once
**Objective:** Verify multi-touch doesn't interfere between controls

1. Place one finger on throttle lever
2. While holding throttle, place second finger on discharge valve knob
3. Adjust both controls simultaneously
4. Release one finger, continue adjusting other

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Both controls respond independently
- ‚úÖ No interference between touch points
- ‚úÖ Values update correctly for both
- ‚úÖ Releasing one finger doesn't affect other control

**Known Issues to Watch For:**
- ‚ùå One control stops responding when second is touched
- ‚ùå Controls affect each other
- ‚ùå Touch IDs getting confused

#### Test: Multiple Discharge Valves
**Objective:** Open/close multiple valves simultaneously

1. Place fingers on two different discharge valve knobs
2. Rotate both at the same time
3. Try with 3+ fingers on different knobs

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ All knobs respond independently
- ‚úÖ No cross-talk between controls
- ‚úÖ Smooth operation even with 3+ touches

### 3. Gesture Interference

#### Test: Accidental Palm Touches
**Objective:** Verify palm rejection works properly

1. Rest palm on tablet while operating controls
2. Use fingers to adjust controls normally
3. Move hand around screen while controlling

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Only intentional finger touches register
- ‚úÖ Palm resting doesn't trigger controls
- ‚úÖ No accidental activation

**Known Issues to Watch For:**
- ‚ùå Palm touches activating controls
- ‚ùå Controls moving unexpectedly
- ‚ùå Need to be overly careful with hand position

#### Test: Swipe/Scroll Gestures
**Objective:** Ensure browser gestures don't interfere

1. Try to swipe up/down on panel area
2. Try to pinch-zoom on controls
3. Attempt two-finger scroll

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Browser gestures are prevented on control area
- ‚úÖ No accidental zoom
- ‚úÖ No page scrolling during control operation
- ‚úÖ Touch-action CSS properly configured

### 4. Touch Precision on Small Controls

#### Test: Small Button/Toggle Precision
**Objective:** Verify touch targets are large enough (WCAG 2.1 AA: 44x44px minimum)

1. Locate smaller controls (DRV toggle, primer button)
2. Tap with finger (not stylus)
3. Try tapping at edges of control
4. Attempt rapid successive taps

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Can reliably hit control with finger
- ‚úÖ Hit area extends beyond visual element
- ‚úÖ No need for stylus or precise targeting
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback on touch (not just hover)

**Measurement:**
Use Touch Debug Overlay to verify touch targets:
- Minimum 44x44 pixels for Level AA compliance
- Recommended 48x48 pixels for comfortable use

### 5. Drag Gestures Performance

#### Test: Rapid Lever Movement
**Objective:** Test performance under rapid control changes

1. Rapidly drag throttle lever up and down
2. Quickly rotate discharge valve knobs
3. Perform rapid successive adjustments

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Maintains 60 FPS (check debug overlay)
- ‚úÖ No dropped frames or stuttering
- ‚úÖ Audio feedback stays synchronized
- ‚úÖ Visual updates remain smooth

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Target FPS: 60
- Acceptable FPS: 55-60
- Warning: 45-54 (investigate)
- Critical: <45 (performance issue)

### 6. Touch Through Overlays

#### Test: Training Overlay Interaction
**Objective:** Verify controls work with overlays active

1. Enable training overlays (Settings)
2. Trigger a training prompt
3. Try to operate controls with overlay visible
4. Dismiss overlay with touch
5. Resume control operation

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Overlay dismisses on touch/tap
- ‚úÖ Controls resume normal operation
- ‚úÖ No lingering touch interference
- ‚úÖ Clear visual indication of interactive elements

#### Test: Settings Panel
**Objective:** Verify settings panel doesn't interfere with controls

1. Open Settings panel
2. Adjust settings while panel is open
3. Close panel
4. Immediately operate controls

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Settings panel dismisses cleanly
- ‚úÖ No ghost touches after closing
- ‚úÖ Controls respond immediately

### 7. Orientation Changes

#### Test: Portrait to Landscape
**Objective:** Verify simulator handles orientation changes

1. Start in portrait mode
2. Rotate to landscape
3. Operate controls in landscape
4. Rotate back to portrait
5. Verify controls still work

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Layout adapts to orientation (if responsive)
- ‚úÖ Controls remain functional
- ‚úÖ No loss of state
- ‚úÖ Touch registration still accurate

**Note:** Simulator is designed for landscape primarily. Portrait may have limited functionality.

### 8. Zoom Prevention

#### Test: Pinch Zoom
**Objective:** Ensure accidental zoom is prevented

1. Attempt pinch-to-zoom on controls
2. Try double-tap zoom on panel
3. Use accessibility zoom

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Pinch zoom is prevented on control area
- ‚úÖ Double-tap doesn't zoom
- ‚úÖ Viewport meta tag properly configured
- ‚úÖ Content remains at correct scale
