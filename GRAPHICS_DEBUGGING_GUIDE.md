# Graphics Rendering Issue - Debugging Guide

## Current Status

✅ **CSP Header Issue: FIXED**
- The sha256 hash has been removed from the CSP header
- `'unsafe-inline'` is now active
- Inline script errors should be resolved

⚠️ **Graphics Not Displaying: INVESTIGATING**
- React app is rendering (confirmed by "App rendering" console message)
- UI components are not visible on the page
- Latest build has been deployed to Pages (JS file updated to `index-hemohJG5.js`)

## What I've Done

1. **Removed CSP hash** from `pump-panel-sim/public/_headers`
2. **Added console logging** to Panel component to verify rendering
3. **Rebuilt and deployed** the latest code to Cloudflare Pages
4. **Verified Pages deployment** - new JS file is now live

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Open the Live Site
- Go to: https://fire-pump-panel-simulator.pages.dev/

### Step 2: Open Browser Developer Tools
- Press `F12` (or right-click → Inspect)
- Go to the **Console** tab

### Step 3: Look for These Messages
- ✅ You should see: `"App rendering"`
- ✅ You should see: `"Panel component rendering"`
- ❌ Look for any RED ERROR messages

### Step 4: Check the Network Tab
- Go to the **Network** tab
- Refresh the page
- Look for any failed requests (red X)
- Check if CSS and JS files loaded successfully (HTTP 200)

### Step 5: Check the Elements Tab
- Go to the **Elements** tab
- Look for the `<div id="root">` element
- Expand it to see if React components are rendered inside
- If empty, React is not rendering
- If full of HTML, React is rendering but CSS might not be applied

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: JavaScript Error in Console
**If you see a red error message:**
- Take a screenshot of the error
- Share it with me
- I'll fix the code and redeploy

### Issue 2: CSS Not Applied (HTML visible but unstyled)
**If you see HTML in the Elements tab but no styling:**
- The CSS file might not be loading
- Check Network tab for CSS file status
- Might be a Tailwind CSS configuration issue

### Issue 3: React Not Rendering (Empty root div)
**If the `<div id="root">` is empty:**
- React failed to mount
- Check Console for errors
- Might be a React or dependency issue

### Issue 4: Graphics Visible but Broken
**If you see the UI but images/gauges are missing:**
- Check Network tab for image requests
- Look for 404 errors on `/gauges/*` files
- Might be an asset path issue

## Files Changed in This Session

- `pump-panel-sim/src/ui/Panel.tsx` - Added image preloading + console logging
- `pump-panel-sim/public/_headers` - Removed CSP hash, added 'unsafe-inline'
- `pump-panel-sim/src/main.tsx` - Added rebuild trigger comment
- `pump-panel-sim/Cloudflare_info.md` - Documented CSP issue

## Next Steps

1. **Open the site and check the console** (follow debugging steps above)
2. **Report any errors you see** - screenshot or copy the error message
3. **I'll fix the issue** and redeploy

## Quick Reference: Browser Console Commands

```javascript
// Check if React is loaded
console.log(window.React)

// Check if the root element exists
console.log(document.getElementById('root'))

// Check if root has children
console.log(document.getElementById('root').children.length)
```
